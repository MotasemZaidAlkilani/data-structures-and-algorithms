# Hashtables
make hashtable class and its methods .
## Challenge
challegne to make hashtable , and make method to set key and value
,relate them to other ,convert key using hash , and put 
them in hash bucket.
## Approach & Efficiency
Time Complexity 

-set() :O(n)

-get() :O(n^2)

-keys() :O(n^2)

-contains() :O(n^2)

-hash() :O(n^2)
____
space Complexity

-set() :O(n^2)

-get() :O(1)

-keys() :O(1)

-contains() :O(1)

-hash() :O(1)
## API
-set() :relate key and value to other , and put them in converted 
index in hashtable.

-get() :get value of the entered key

-keys() :get all keys with their values inside hashtable.

-contains() :check if key exists in hashtable

-hash() :get the index of key in hashtable
