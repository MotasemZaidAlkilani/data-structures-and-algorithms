# Stacks and Queues
challenge to make stacks and queues classes using linkedlist.

## Challenge

making stacks and queue classes ,and able to add or delete nodes from it ,and make function
to check if it is empty.

## Approach & Efficiency
I choose space complexity approach for this challenge.
space Complexity is O(1)

## API
**Stack methods :**

-push :to add new nodes in the top of currents values.

-pop  :to remove the top value in stack.

-peek : to get the top node in stack

-isEmpty :to check if the stack is empty or not.

**Queue methods :**

-enqueue : to add new node to the end of queue

-dequeue : to delete the first node in the queue.

-isEmpty :to check if the queue is empty or not.

-peek : to get the first node in stack
