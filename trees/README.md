# Trees
I did the following :

1-binary tree class has orders methods 

2-binary search tree to add values and check if specific value
is exist

## Challenge
challenge making tree and add values to it ,and appear the data
in different order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Space O(1)

Time O(1)
## API

-depthTreePreOrder : show u values in pre-order way

-depthTreePostOrder :  show u tree values in post-order way

-depthTreeinOrder :  show u tree values in in-order way

-add :add node to tree in right place depend of the value

-contains :check if value are exists in tree or not
