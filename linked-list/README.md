# Singly Linked List
linked list is data structure like an array ,but u access data 
in different way ,linked list store the data inside node ,and node
have pointer to next node , there two types of linked list ,
first one is single linked list ,it is the standard one ,the other one
is the double linked list ,the different between them ,that double
linked list has another pointer to previous node.


## Challenge
challenge for making in the first empty linked list ,then make method
to add values to the list ,and another method to check if value are 
exist in the list ,and the last method to print linked list values as 
string format.
## Approach & Efficiency
I choose to make less time completity as i can and here the result of
the method:

insert method :O(1)

includes method :O(n)

toString method :O(n)

## API
insert method :to insert values  at the first of linked list 

includes method :to check if the enterd value are exist in linked list

toString method :to print all the values in linkList as String format
